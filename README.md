	Dap Buddy allows you to manage <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/implementors/adapters/">debuggers</a> provided by 
<a href="https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap">nvim-dap</a>. It should ease out the process of installing, configuring and interacting with said debuggers. No troubleshooting needed. Just _plug and play_. At the moment the plugin has gone through some problems that could be traced back to the codebase itself; that's why I'm going to be doing a rewrite: faster, better, and without all the bugs it originally had.
	Stay tuned!

### üõ†Ô∏è Development

1. Clone the repo
2. Run this command:
```bash
make
```
> This will load nvim and append your local clone's git root path to a new sessions' runtime path

3. After changing anything run (within nvim):
```vimscript
:luafile %
```
> Where `%` is the current file. It may be any other file's path.
